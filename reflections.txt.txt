 How does your gem take advantage of Ruby’s metaprogramming capabilities?

	We use define_method to create 9 color instance methods as oppose to created them individually.  We also use the send in the sample_colors to call each of the color instance methods.
And, the following reflections:

    How long did you spend working on this project?
	About 4 hours which is considerably less than I have spent on previous projects.
    What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
	Figuring out how define_method works to save the time of writing individual instance methods,
    Where do you still have room to grow?
	I had some trouble understanding exactly what "self" is and what are some common use cases for it.
